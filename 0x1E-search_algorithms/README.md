# C - Search Algorithms

This was my ALX project on search algorithms. I implemented
various types of search algorithms and stated the corresponding space/time
complexities for each.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files for all tasks. Provided by ALX.

## Helper Files :raised_hands:

* [listint](./listint): Folder of helper files for task 12, singly linked list
jump search.
  * [create_list.c](./listint/create_list.c): C function that creates a `listint_t`
singly linked list.
  * [free_list.c](./listint/free_list.c): C function that frees a `listint_t`
singly linked list.
  * [print_list.c](./listint/print_list.c): C function that prints the contents
of a `listint_t` singly linked list.

* [skiplist](./skiplist): Folder of helper files for task 13, singly skipped list
jump search.
  * [create_skiplist.c](./skiplist/create_skiplist.c): C function that creates
a `skiplist_t` singly skipped list.
  * [free_skiplist.c](./skiplist/free_skiplist.c): C function that frees a
`skiplist_t` singly skipped list.
  * [print_skiplist.c](./skiplist/print_skiplist.c): C function that prints the
contents of a `skiplist_t` singly skipped list.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [search_algos.h](./search_algos.h): Header file containing definitions and
prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.

Data Structures

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Linear search**
  * [0-linear.c](./0-linear.c): C function that searches for a value in an array
  of integers using linear search.
  * If the value is not present or the array is `NULL`, returns `-1`.
	* Otherwise, returns the first index where `value` is located.

* **1. Binary search**
  * [1-binary.c](./1-binary.c): C function that searches for a value in a sorted
  array of integers using binary search.
  * Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order and that the value to search
  for is not repeated in the array.
  * If the value is not present or the array is `NULL`, returns `-1`.
	* Otherwise, returns the index where `value` is located.

* **2. Big O #0**
  * [2-O](./2-O): Text file containing the worst case time complexity of linear
  search.

* **3. Big O #1**
  * [3-O](./3-O): Text file containing the worst case space complexity of
  iterative linear search.

* **4. Big O #2**
  * [4-O](./4-O): Text file containing worst case case time complexity
  of binary search.

  * [6-O](./6-O): Text file containing the space complexity of the following algorithm:
```
int **allocate_map(int n, int m)

    int **map;

    map = malloc(sizeof(int *) * n);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {

* **7. Jump search**
  * [100-jump.c](./100-jump.c): C function that searches for a value in a
  sorted array of integers using jump search.
  * Uses the square root of the size of the array as the jump step.
  * Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order and that the value to search
  for is not repeated in the array.
  * If the value is not present or the array is `NULL`, returns `-1`.
	* Otherwise, returns the index where `value` is located.

  for a value in a sorted array of integers using advanced binary search.
  * Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order.
  * If the value is not present or the array is `NULL`, returns `-1`.
	* Otherwise, returns the first index where `value` is located.

* **12. Jump search in a singly linked list**
  * [105-jump_list.c](./105-jump_list.c): C function that searches for a value
  in a `listint_t` sorted singly linked list of integers using jump search.
  * Uses the square root of the list size as the jump step.
  * Assumes that the singly linked list is sorted in ascending order.
	* If the value is not present or the head of the list is `NULL`, returns `NULL`.
	* Otherwise, returns a pointer to the first node where `value` is located.
