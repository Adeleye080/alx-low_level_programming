# C - More functions, more nested loops

In this project, I continued to learn about using nested loops and writing functions in C.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

| File                     | Prototype                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `0-isupper.c`            | `int _isupper(int c);`           |
| `1-isdigit.c`            | `int _isdigit(int c);`           |
| `2-mul.c`                | `int mul(int a, int b);`         |
| `3-print_numbers.c`      | `void print_numbers(void);`      |
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` | `void print_most_numbers(void);` |
| `5-more_numbers.c`       | `void more_numbers(void);`       |
| `6-print_line.c`         | `void print_line(int n);`        |
| `7-print_diagonal.c`     | `void print_diagonal(int n);`    |
| `8-print_square.c`       | `void print_square(int size);`   |
| `10-print_triangle.c`    | `void print_triangle(int size);` |
| `101-print_number.c`     | `void print_number(int n);`      |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. isupper**
  * [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c): C function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns
  `1` if the character is uppercase, `0` otherwise.

* **1. isdigit**
  * [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c): C function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).
  Returns `1` if the character is a digit, `0` otherwise.

* **2. Collaboration is multiplication**
  * [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c): C function that multiplies two integers. Returns the value of
  the multiplication.

* **3. The numbers speak for themselves**
  * [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers `0` to
  `9`, followed by a new line.

* **4. I believe in numbers and signs**
  * [4-print_most_numbers](./4-print_most_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers
  `0` to `9` except for `2` and `4`, followed by a new line.

* **5. Numbers constitute the only universal language**
  * [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers `0` to
  `14`, followed by a new line, ten times.

* **6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**
  * [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c): C function that draws a straight line in the terminal
  using the character `_`, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* **7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**
  * [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c): C function that draws a diagonal
  line in the terminal using the `\` character, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* **8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch**
  * [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c): C function that prints a square using the `#`
  character, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* **9. Fizz-Buzz**
  * [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c): C program that prints the numbers from `1` to
  `100`, but for multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number, for
  multiples of five, `Buzz`, and for multiples of both three and five, `FizzBuzz`.
    * Each number or word is separated by a space.

* **10. Triangles**
  * [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c): C function that prints a triangle using
  the `#` character, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* **11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic**
  * [100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c): C program that prints the largest prime factor
  of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

* **12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**
  * [101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c): C function that prints an integer without
  using `long`, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.
